  <p>lover’s dream potion<br>

  I first put a branch of lavendar , this will help my lover slumber into sleep.<br>
  
  I then mix the the brittle of quartz with handful of rose pettles, in order to cast the spell of love.<br>
  
  Then delicately I add one third of a tumbleweed, this will confuse my lover and scramble his thoughts.<br>
  
  lastly, I will add the water pressed from moss dirived from the highest of mountains, where the moss is hidden deep under the blankets of snow.<br>
  
  This water will be the binder of all the ingredients, my potion is complete.<br>

  <p> Abundance<br> 
The Abundance Charm conjures a feast from thin air, filled with delicious, perfectly prepared dishes to satisfy every craving.<br> 
As the spell is cast, the scent of fresh-baked goods and ripe fruits fills the space. <br> 
<br> 
To summon the feast, recite:<br> 

"From air to plate, my hunger wanes,<br> 
A feast appears where none remains.<br> 
By hearth and home, by fire and art,<br> 
Bring forth the meals to fill my heart."<br> 

The magic is fleeting; the feast lingers only for an hour before fading like morning mist. Use it in times of true need or celebration.
