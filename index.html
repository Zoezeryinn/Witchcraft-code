      Witch Mania tells the tale of contemporary witchcraft. Through three digital zine publications that delve into different concepts of what it means to be a witch in the modern age that we live in. 

“The Coven” consists of a group of women who have redefined what witchcraft means to them. Each have written and conjured a spell of their own, whether it be in the form of alchemy or incantations. The coven includes rituals passed on, intended for the right person to find it.

“Casted spells” includes a collection of totems and charms from various historical periods and cultures. These selected objects placed together as one; explores and unites witches throughout history and space. Recontextualising how witchcraft could manifest in present time.

“Written work” brings to light the work of Silvia Federici, an Italian-American scholar, teacher, and feminist activist. The chosen chapter examines the historical and modern intersections of witch-hunting and the oppression of women within the context of capitalism, colonialism, and patriarchal power structures. The socio-political issues that have continued to bleed into the 21st century.
