        <strong> FOUR</strong>
        <br>
<i> Witch-Hunting and the Fear of the Power of Women</i>
<br>
<br>
She stands alone, in the twilight, in an empty space,
holding in her hands a skein of blue yarn that weaves
around her to embrace a cluster of homes, which, because
of this, appear almost as a continuation of her body.
Trazando el Camino (1990) is among the many paintings
that Rodolfo Morales, one of Mexico’s best twentieth century
artists, has dedicated to the main theme of his
work: the female body as the material and social fabric
holding the community together. Morales’s painting is a
counterpoint to the image of the witch, as with her quiet
look and embroidered apron the woman it represents
looks almost angelic. Yet something magical and secretive
about her recalls the female ‘conspiracy’ that was
the historical justification for the witch hunts that bloodied
Europe from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century,
perhaps providing a clue to some of the mysteries at the
heart of this persecution that historians have yet to solve.
<br>
<br>
Why were the witch hunts primarily directed against
women? How does one explain that for three centuries
thousands of women in Europe became the personification
of ‘the enemy within’ and absolute evil? And how to
reconcile the all-powerful, almost mythical portrait that
inquisitors and demonologists painted of their victims—as
creatures of hell, terrorists, man-eaters, servants of the
Devil wildly riding the skies on their broomsticks—with 
the defenseless figures of the actual women who were
charged with these crimes and then horribly tortured and
burned at the stake?
<br>
<br>
A first answer to these questions traces the persecution
of the ‘witches’ back to the dislocations caused by the
development of capitalism, in particular the disintegration
of the communal forms of agriculture that had prevailed
in feudal Europe and the pauperization into which the rise
of a monetary economy and land dispossession plunged
broad sectors of both the rural and urban populations.
According to this theory, women were those most likely
to be victimized because they were the most ‘disempowered’
by these changes, especially older women, who often
rebelled against their impoverishment and social exclusion
and who constituted the bulk of the accused. In other
words, women were charged with witchcraft because the
restructuring of rural Europe at the dawn of capitalism
destroyed their means of livelihood and the basis of their
social power, leaving them with no resort but dependence
on the charity of the better-o! at a time when communal
bonds were disintegrating and a new morality was
taking hold that criminalized begging and looked down
upon charity, the reputed path to eternal salvation in the
medieval world.
<br>
<br>
This theory, first articulated by Alan Macfarlane in his
Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England, certainly
applies to many witch trials. There is undoubtedly a direct
relation between many cases of witch-hunting and the
process of the ‘enclosures,’ as demonstrated by the social
composition of the accused, the charges made against
them, and the common characterization of the witch as
a poor old woman, living alone, dependent on donations
from her neighbors, bitterly resenting her marginalization,
and often threatening and cursing those who refused to
help her, who inevitably accused her of being responsiblefor all their misadventures. This picture, however, does
not explain how such wretched creatures could inspire
so much fear. It also does not account for the fact that
many among the accused were charged with sexual transgressions
and reproductive crimes (such as infanticide
and causing male impotence), and among the condemned
there were women who had achieved a certain degree
of power in the community, working as folk healers and
midwives or exercising magical practices, such as finding
lost objects and divination.
<br>
<br>
Besides resistance to pauperization and social marginalization,
what threats did ‘witches’ pose in the eyes of
those who planned to exterminate them? Answering this
question requires that we recapture not only the social
conflicts that the development of capitalism generated,
but its radical transformation of every aspect of social life,
beginning with the reproductive/gender relations that had
characterized the medieval world.
<br>
<br>
Capitalism was born out of the strategies that the feudal
elite—the Church and the landed and merchant classes—
implemented in response to the struggles of the rural and
urban proletariat that by the fourteenth century were
placing their rule in crisis. It was a ‘counterrevolution,’ not
only suffocating in blood the new demands for freedom
but turning the world upside down through the creation of
a new system of production requiring a di!erent conception
of work, wealth, and value that was useful for more
intense forms of exploitation. As such, from its inception
the capitalist class was confronted with a double challenge.
On one hand, it had to defeat the threat posed by the
expropriated commoners turned vagabonds, beggars, and
landless laborers ready to revolt against the new masters,
especially in the period between 1##0 and 1%#0, when
inflation caused by the arrival of gold and silver from theNew World “was accelerating to uncontrollable proportions,”
causing food prices to skyrocket, while wages were
correspondingly declining.! In that context, the presence
in many peasant communities of old women, resentful
of their dismal state, going from door to door muttering
words of vengeance, could certainly be feared as a breeder
of conspiratorial plots.
<br>
<br>
On the other hand, as a mode of production positing
‘industry’ as the main source of the accumulation, capitalism
could not take hold without forging a new type of
individual and a new social discipline boosting the productive
capacity of labor. This involved a historic battle
against anything posing a limit to the full exploitation of
the laborer, starting with the web of relations that tied the
individuals to the natural world, to other people, and to
their own bodies. Key to this process was the destruction
of the magical conception of the body that had prevailed
in the Middle Ages, which attributed to it powers that
the capitalist class could not exploit, that were incompatible
with the transformation of the laborers into work
machines, and that could even enhance their resistance
to it. These were the shamanic powers that precapitalist,
agricultural societies have attributed to all or to special
individuals, and that in Europe survived despite centuries
of Christianization, often being assimilated into Christian
rituals and beliefs.
<br>
<br>
It is in this context that the attack on women as
‘witches’ should be located. Because of their unique relation
to the process of reproduction, women in many precapitalist
societies have been credited with a special
understanding of the secrets of nature, presumably enabling
them to procure life and death and discover the
hidden property of things. Practicing magic (as healers,
folk doctors, herbalists, midwives, makers of love-philters)
was also for many women a source of employment and undoubtedly a source of power, although it exposed them
to revenge when their remedies failed.
<br>
<br>
This is one reason why women became the primary
targets in the capitalist attempt to construct a more mechanized
conception of the world. The ‘rationalization’ of the
natural world—the precondition for a more regimented
work discipline and for the scientific revolution—passed
through the destruction of the ‘witch.’ Even the unspeakable
tortures to which the accused women were subjected
acquire a di!erent meaning when we conceive them as a
form of exorcism against their powers.
<br>
<br>
In this context we must also reconsider the portrayal
of women’s sexuality as something diabolical, the quintessence
of female ‘magic,’ which is central to the definition of
witchcraft. The classic interpretation of this phenomenon
blames it on the inquisitors’ sexual prurience and sadism
born out of their repressive ascetic lives. But, although
the participation of ecclesiastics in the witch hunt was
fundamental to the construction of its ideological scaffold,
by the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when
the witch hunt was most intense in Europe, the majority
of witch trials were conducted by lay magistrates and paid
for and organized by city governments. Thus, we must ask
what female sexuality represented in the eyes of the new
capitalist elite in view of their social-reformation project
and institution of a stricter discipline of labor.
<br>
<br>
A preliminary answer, drawn from the regulations
introduced in most of Western Europe in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries with regard to sex, marriage,
adultery, and procreation, is that female sexuality was
both seen as a social threat and, if properly channeled, a
powerful economic force. Like the Fathers of the Church
and the Dominican authors of the Malleus Maleficarum
(1486),& the nascent capitalist class needed to degrade
female sexuality and pleasure. Eros, sexual attraction, hasalways been suspect in the eyes of political elites, as an
uncontrollable force. Plato’s account of the e!ects of love
in the Symposium gives an ontological dimension to this
view. Love is the great magician, the demon that unites
earth and sky and makes humans so round, so whole in
their being, that once united they cannot be defeated.
The Fathers of the Church, who in the fourth century AD
went to the African desert to escape the corruption of
urban life and presumably the enticements of Eros, had
to acknowledge its power, being tormented by a desire
that they could only imagine to be inspired by the Devil.
Since that time, the need to protect the cohesiveness of
the Church as a patriarchal, masculine clan and to prevent
its property from being dissipated because of clerical
weakness in the face of female power, led the clergy to
paint the female sex as an instrument of the Devil—the
more pleasant to the eye, the more deadly to the soul.
This is the leitmotif of every demonology, starting with
the Malleus Maleficarum, possibly the most misogynous
text ever written. Whether Catholic, Protestant, or Puritan,
the rising bourgeoisie continued this tradition, but with
a twist, as the repression of female desire was placed at
the service of utilitarian goals such as the satisfaction of
men’s sexual needs and more importantly the procreation
of an abundant workforce. Once exorcised, denied
its subversive potential through the witch hunt, female
sexuality could be recuperated in a matrimonial context
and for procreative ends.
<br>
<br>
Compared with the Christian praise of chastity and
asceticism, the sexual norm instituted by the burgher/
capitalist class with the Protestant reintegration of sex
into matrimonial life as a ‘remedy to concupiscence’ and
the recognition of a legitimate role for women in the community
as wives and mothers has often been portrayed as
a break with the past. But what capitalism reintegrated into the realm of acceptable female social behavior was
a tamed, domesticated form of sexuality, instrumental
to the reproduction of labor power and the pacification
of the workforce. In capitalism, sex can exist but only as
a productive force at the service of procreation and the
regeneration of the waged/male worker and as a means of
social appeasement and compensation for the misery of
everyday existence. Typical of the new bourgeois sexual
morality was Martin Luther’s injunction to the nuns to
leave the convents and get married, as marriage and the
production of an abundant prole was in his view women’s
fulfillment of God’s will and their ‘highest vocation.’ “Let
them bear children to death,” he apparently declared.
“They are created for that.”! No sixteenth-century political
or religious authority expressed this sentiment as crudely
as Luther, but the restriction of women’s sexuality to marriage
and procreation, together with wifely unconditional
obedience, was instituted in every country—regardless
of its religious creed—as the pillar of social morality and
political stability. And, indeed, of no crime were ‘witches’
as frequently accused as ‘lewd behavior,’ generally associated
with infanticide and an inherent hostility to the
reproduction of life.
<br>
<br>
Outside these parameters, outside of marriage, procreation,
and male/institutional control, for the capitalists
as well, female sexuality has historically represented a
social danger, a threat to the discipline of work, a power
over others, and an obstacle to the maintenance of social
hierarchies and class relations. This was especially the
case in the sixteenth century, when the structures that
in feudal society had regulated sexual conduct and the
sexual exchange between women and men entered into
crisis and a new phenomenon emerged, both in the cities
and rural areas, that of unattached women, living alone,
often practicing prostitution.
<br>
<br>
Not surprisingly, the charge of sexual perversion was
as central to the trials organized by lay authorities as to
those initiated and directed by the Inquisition. Here too,
beneath the fantastic charge of copulation with the Devil,
we find the fear that women could bewitch men with their
‘glamour,’ bring them under their power, and inspire in
them such desire as to cause them to forget all social distances
and obligations. Such was the case, according to
Guido Ruggiero’s Binding Passions (!99#), with the courtesans
in sixteenth-century Venice who managed to contract
marriages with noblemen but were then accused of
being witches.
<br>
<br>
The fear of women’s uncontrolled sexuality explains
the popularity in the demonologies of the myth of Circe,
the legendary enchantress who by her magical arts transformed
the men lusting after her into animals. It also
accounts for the many speculations by the same demonologies
concerning the power of women’s eyes to move men
without a touch, simply by the force of their ‘glamour’ and
‘fascination.’ Also, the ‘pact’ that the witches were accused
of making with the Devil, which generally involved a monetary
exchange, manifests the concern for women’s ability
to gain money from men that underlies the condemnation
of prostitution.
<br>
<br>
Thus, no effort was spared to paint female sexuality
as something dangerous for men and to humiliate women
in such a way as to curb their desire to use their bodies
to attract them. Never in history have women been subjected
to such a massive, internationally organized, legally
approved, religiously blessed assault on their bodies. On
the flimsiest evidence, generally nothing more than a
denunciation, thousands were arrested, stripped naked,
completely shaved, and then pricked with long needles in
every part of their bodies in search of the ‘Devil’s mark,’
often in the presence of men, from the executioner tothe local notables and priests. And this was by no means
the end of their torments. The most sadistic tortures ever
invented were inflicted on the body of the woman accused,
which provided an ideal laboratory for the development of
a science of pain and torture.
<br>
<br>
As I wrote in Caliban and the Witch, the witch hunt
instituted a regime of terror on all women, from which
emerged the new model of femininity to which women
had to conform to be socially accepted in the developing
capitalist society: sexless, obedient, submissive, resigned
to subordination to the male world, accepting as natural
the confinement to a sphere of activities that in capitalism
has been completely devalued.
<br>
<br>
Women were terrorized through fantastic accusations,
horrendous torture, and public executions because their
social power had to be destroyed—a power that in the eyes
of their persecutors was obviously significant, even in the
case of older women. Old women, in fact, could seduce the
younger into their evils ways and would likely transmit
forbidden knowledge, like that of abortion-inducing plants,
and carry the collective memory of their community. As
Robert Muchembled has reminded us, elderly women were
the ones who remembered the promises made, the faith
betrayed, the extent of property (especially in land), the
customary agreements, and who was responsible for violating
them. Like the blue yarn in Trazando el Camino,
old women going from house to house circulated stories
and secrets, binding passions and weaving together past
and present events. As such they were a disturbing, fearinspiring
presence for a reforming elite of modernizers
bent on destroying the past, controlling people’s behavior
down to their instinctual life, and undoing customary relations
and obligations.
<br>
<br>
The portrayal of women’s earthly challenges to
the power structures as a demonic conspiracy is aphenomenon that has played out over and over in history
down to our times. The McCarthy ‘witch hunt’ against
communism and the ‘War on Terror’ have both relied on
such dynamics. The exaggeration of ‘crimes’ to mythical
proportions so as to justify horrendous punishments is
an elective means to terrorize a whole society, isolate
the victims, discourage resistance, and make masses of
people afraid to engage in practices that until then were
considered normal.
<br>
<br>
The witch was the communist and terrorist of her
time, which required a ‘civilizing’ drive to produce the
new ‘subjectivity’ and sexual division of labor on which
the capitalist work discipline would rely. The witch hunts
were the means by which women in Europe were educated
about their new social tasks and a massive defeat
was inflicted on Europe’s ‘lower classes,’ who needed to
learn about the power of the state to desist from any form
of resistance to its rule. At the stakes not only were the
bodies of the ‘witches’ destroyed, so was a whole world
of social relations that had been the basis of women’s
social power and a vast body of knowledge that women
had transmitted from mother to daughter over the generations—
knowledge of herbs, of the means of contraception
or abortion, of what magic to use to obtain the love of men.
<br>
<br>
This is what was consumed on every village square
with the execution of the women accused, who would be
exhibited in the most abject state: tied up with iron chains
and given to the fire. When in our imagination we multiply
this scene by the thousands, we begin to understand what
the witch hunt meant for Europe, in terms of not only its
motifs but also its effects.
